# Pedagogical Aid: Delaunay Triangles

by Nicholas Deary and Drew Haiber

## Description

A website to help visualize the process of the Delaunay triangulation 
algorithm. The focus will be on 2D triangulation, with a stretch goal 
of implementing 3D triangulation.

## Timeline

| Week    | Goal                                                            |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 5  | Research and learn the algorithms.                              |
| Week 6  | Implement the 2D algorithm in JavaScript or TypeScript.         |
| Week 7  | Learn PaperJS and research 2D web graphics.                     |
| Week 8  | Create a visual output for the algorithm.                       |
| Week 9  | Add buttons to step through the algorithm one action at a time. |
| Week 10 | Make pseudocode that follows along with the algorithm.          |
| Week 11 | Write background information and relevant paragraphs.           |
| Week 12 | Refine project and thoroughly test.                             |
| Week 13 | If time remains, add a 3D implementation.                       |
| Week 14 | Make presentation and practice it.                              |

## Distributing the Work

Pair program whenever possible, plan which functions need to be written and by 
whom, and maintain clear communication through Discord.
